##Why Integrate Data?

Apps host data. The hosted Loomio sevice hosts comments, votes  developers may find further uses for the data generated in other apps. When apps permit users to share data other apps can repurpose the data in different ways. Developers can focus on a particular domain where their app excels and allow other apps to deal with the related but separate problems rather than trying to develop a toolbox that does everything. 

The 'blank slate' describes a common problem where a new app could be well designed and potentially useful but lacks content. The app's value may rely on having a critical mass of existing data with which the user can interact. App promoters are often caught in a catch-22 where they need users to sign up to begin adding content, but find it difficult to convince potential users to do so when this initial content does not exist. By connecting and importing data from other apps the app could 'seed' enough content and demonstrate its value to users.

Users may have political or privacy concerns and wish to host their own a data themselves or with a group they trust. In the Web's current state multiple private providers host and control user data and experience. These third-party buinesss typically provide  a 'free' service to users but sell advertising, or onsell user data to sustain the business. A discussion of the private control of data vs the movement to shift control back to users themselves is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice to say that many people are not satisfied with the Web in its current state (including us!).

Further, with linked data (discussed below) these terms reference others in existing standard vocabularies, meaning that these features will work for data stored in apps that are not *directly* in (or even aware of) the ecosystem. In fact, if apps decide to use a linked data format they are not required to use precisely these terms, only to link to the same term at its source vocabulary.
